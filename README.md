Classifying obesity levels with Machine Learning models based on several features.

Dataset of this project is available from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurbajaj9/obesity-levels?select=ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv

1. Data exploration
- Plot to see and understand the dataset
- Plot the correlation and distributions between features
2. Data preprocessing
- Data cleaning
- Data scaling
- Data encoding
- Split dataset into training dataset and testing dataset
3. Apply Machine Learning models on the dataset
  Some Machine Learning models I use in this project:
  - Support Vector Machine Classifier
  - K Nearest Neighbors Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Neural Network Classifier
- Fit the models with the training dataset
- Use the model to predict the labels on the testing dataset
- Evaluate the models with different metrics
4. Testing the models on created dataset
- Create a new dataset
- Apply the model to see the results
