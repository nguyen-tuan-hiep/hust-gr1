# Classifying obesity levels with Machine Learning models based on several features.

The dataset using in this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurbajaj9/obesity-levels?select=ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv)


## 0. Installation
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (a popular open-source Python distribution platform)
- Install libraries

```bash
  conda install numpy
  conda install pandas
  conda install matplotlib
  conda install seaborn
  pip install tensorflow
```

## 1. Data exploration
- Visualize the data distributions to understand the dataset
- Plot the correlation and distributions between features
## 2. Data preprocessing
- Data cleaning (handle missing/null/NaN values)
- Data scaling (normalize/standardaize the data)
- Data encoding (convert the categorical values into numeric values)
- Data splitting (split dataset into training dataset and testing dataset)
## 3. Apply Machine Learning models on the dataset
- Some Machine Learning models I use in this project:
  - Support Vector Machine Classifier
  - K Nearest Neighbors Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Neural Network Classifier

- Fit the models with the training dataset
- Use the model to predict the labels on the testing dataset
- Evaluate the models with different metrics
## 4. Testing the models on created dataset
- Create a new dataset
- Apply the model to see the results
